# Election-Analysis
Module 3

## Overview of Election Audit
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
The purpose of this project was to help Tom assess the voting records from the local elections. This helped breakdown the votes and establish a winner. 

## Election-Audit Results
After completing the analysis we are able to see the total number of votes, the county that produced the most votes, and the name and percentage the winner one by. The code that we ran a spreadsheet into a text file to make it readable for Tom and his team.
*How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  There were 369,711 total votes
*Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
  Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855) 
  Denver: 82.8% (306,055) 
  Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801) 
*Which county had the largest number of votes?

## Election-Audit Summary
 In conclusion, this project allowed us to take a detailed .csv file and pick it apart to find specific data of the total number of votes, the winner, and the percentages on a candidate and county basis. The code we have started could be provide a deeper breakdown for future elections to help disect the information to get a more geographically look.
